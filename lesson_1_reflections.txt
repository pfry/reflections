How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Any differences are brought to the users attention.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Less time is spent finding and correcting changes made in error.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Itâ€™s benificial to have logically defined commits, but the user must remember
    to commit and provide an appropriately descriptive message.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Not all version control systems need to track multiple, interrelated files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log can summarize the purpose of individual commits, while git diff
    compares the details of changes between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing that changes can be easily reverted allows for quick testing.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
