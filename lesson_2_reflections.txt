What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A git directory is created with the files necessary for a repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It allows only certain files within a directory to be tracked in a repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    Changes can be verified using ‘git diff —staged’ before making a commit.
